echo "--------------------"
echo "1. The unknown/unknown platform issue is typically caused by:"
echo "   - Incomplete multi-platform builds"
echo "   - Docker Buildx configuration issues"
echo "   - Base image platform compatibility problems"
echo ""
echo "2. Solutions implemented:"
echo "   ‚úÖ Added explicit platform arguments to Dockerfile"
echo "   ‚úÖ Updated GitHub Actions with proper Buildx configuration"
echo "   ‚úÖ Disabled provenance and SBOM to avoid metadata issues"
echo "   ‚úÖ Specified explicit platform support in workflow"
echo ""
echo "3. Next steps:"
echo "   - Push the updated configuration to trigger a new build"
echo "   - The new build should only create linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 images"
echo "   - The unknown/unknown image will be replaced automatically"

echo ""
echo "üöÄ Recommended Actions:"
echo "----------------------"
echo "1. Commit and push the updated .github/workflows/docker-build.yml and Dockerfile"
echo "2. Create a new tag or push to main branch to trigger the workflow"
echo "3. Monitor the GitHub Actions build process"
echo "4. Verify the new images only contain expected platforms:"
echo "   docker manifest inspect $FULL_IMAGE:latest"

echo "üí° If you want to manually clean up the registry (requires admin access):"
echo "   - Go to GitHub Packages: https://github.com/jomonylw/flow-balance/pkgs/container/flow-balance"
echo "   - Delete the problematic image versions"
echo "   - Re-run the GitHub Actions workflow"

echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Configuration fixes have been applied!"
echo "   The next build should resolve the unknown/unknown platform issue."
